LanceDB is a vector database built on top of the Lance columnar format.
It is optimized for machine learning and AI workloads.

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) combines a vector search step
with a large language model to answer questions based on external documents.

This project is my personal learning project to build an enterprise-grade RAG system
with metadata filtering, versioned document updates, and citations.
